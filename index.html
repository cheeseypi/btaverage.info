        <h3>So how do you play?</h3>
        <p>Better Than Average is played in a style somewhat reminiscent of King of the Hill.</p>
        <h4>The Initial Round</h4>
        <p>At the start of the tournament there will be an initial round, all players enter the same CelesteNet lobby
            and start on Chapter 1 A-side. At the mark of the referee, all players hit the 'retry' option and then start
            moving through the course.</p>
        <p>Once all players have reached the end, the fastest player on that course is allowed to choose the course for
            the first competitive round of play.</p>
        <h4>The Competitive Rounds</h4>
        <p>All players start in the same manner as the initial round, but on the course of the inital round victor's
            choosing.</p>
        <p>After the round is over, the person in last place is up for elimination. They get to chose the course for the
            next round, but they must come in first place on that course or else they will be eliminated.</p>
        <p>Play continues in repeated competitive rounds until there are two players remaining</p>
        <h4>The Final Round</h4>
        <p>Both players are placed in Farewell. The timer is set at 15 minutes. Both players start in the same manner as
            the above, and whoever gets farther in the course in that time is crowned the victor</p>
        <br />
        <h4>Additional Rules</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Courses must be chosen from Chapters 1-8, A, B, or C sides. Farewell is off limits until the final
                round.</li>
            <li>All timing for rankings uses Celeste's in-game chapter speedrun timer. Make sure you turn it on before
                entering the initial round.</li>
            <li>During competitive rounds, if the player in last place is also the eliminated player, the player who
                placed second-to-last will be up for elimination and gets to choose the next course.</li>
            <li>All players must play on CelesteNet with the rest of their division. Racing on your own and submitting
                times manually will not be allowed</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These rules are subject to minor changes before the start of the event, however the basic structure will be as above.</p>
