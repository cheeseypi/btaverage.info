        <h3>So how do you play?</h3>
        <p>Better Than Average is played in a style somewhat reminiscent of King of the Hill.</p>
        <h4>The Initial Round</h4>
        <p>At the start of the tournament there will be an initial round, all players enter the same CelesteNet lobby
            and start on Chapter 1 A-side. At the mark of the referee, all players hit the 'retry' option and then start
            moving through the course.</p>
        <p>Once all players have reached the end, the fastest player on that course is allowed to choose the course for
            the first competitive round of play.</p>
        <h4>The Competitive Rounds</h4>
        <p>All players start in the same manner as the initial round, but on the course of the inital round victor's
            choosing.</p>
        <p>After the round is over, the person in last place is up for elimination. They get to chose the course for the
            next round, but they must come in first place on that course or else they will be eliminated.</p>
        <p>Play continues in repeated competitive rounds until there are two players remaining</p>
        <h4>The Final Round</h4>
        <p>Both players are placed in Farewell. The timer is set at 15 minutes. Both players start in the same manner as
            the above, and whoever gets farther in the course in that time is crowned the victor</p>
        <br />
        <h4>Additional Rules</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Courses must be chosen from Chapters 1-8, A, B, or C sides. Farewell is off limits until the final
                round.</li>
            <li>A player may not choose a course that has already been played, unless all other courses have already
                been played at least once</li>
            <li>All timing for rankings uses Celeste's in-game chapter speedrun timer. Make sure you turn it on before
                entering the initial round.</li>
            <li>During competitive rounds, if the player in last place is also the eliminated player, the player who
                placed second-to-last will be up for elimination and gets to choose the next course.</li>
            <li>All players must play on CelesteNet with the rest of their division. Racing on your own and submitting
                times manually will not be allowed</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These rules are subject to minor changes before the start of the event, however the basic structure will be
            as above.</p>

        <h4>Special Rules for Summer '22<!-- will be announced soon--></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player will have an extra opportunity to use during their own redemption round.</li>
            <li>These opportunities can be used only once per person per division (If a player moves on to another division, they can take advantage of that division's opportunity)</li>
            <li>Blue <span aria-ignore="true">&#x1F499</span> and Red <span aria-ignore="true">&#x2764&#xFE0F</span> divisions: Any A-Side with the cassette + heart pickup</li>
            <li>Yellow <span aria-ignore="true">&#x1F49B</span> and Cracked <span aria-ignore="true">&#x1F90D</span> divisions: Bny%/Cny% - Run the A-Side to the cassette and switch to the B-Side. If the B-Side has already been chosen, the C-Side will be run after the cassette pickup. The B/C side will be eliminated from play after this choice, the A-Side will not.</li>
        </ul>
